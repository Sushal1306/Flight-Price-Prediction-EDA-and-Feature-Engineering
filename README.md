# Flight-Price-Prediction-EDA-and-Feature-Engineering

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting flight ticket prices using a dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to explore the data through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and apply Feature Engineering to improve the accuracy of predictive models. The dataset contains various features related to flight details, and the project highlights key steps in data preprocessing, analysis, and feature extraction.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhambathwal/flight-price-prediction). It includes 11 features such as:

- **Airline**: The airline company.
- **Source City**: The departure city.
- **Destination City**: The arrival city.
- **Departure Time**: Time of departure, categorized into bins.
- **Arrival Time**: Time of arrival, categorized into bins.
- **Stops**: Number of stops between source and destination.
- **Class**: Seat class (Business/Economy).
- **Duration**: Total travel time.
- **Days Left**: Days left until the flight date.
- **Price**: The target variable representing the ticket price.

## Project Highlights

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed an in-depth analysis of the dataset to uncover patterns, correlations, and anomalies.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created 3 new features, including time bins for departure and arrival times, and the number of days left until departure.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and transformed the data to ensure it was ready for modeling, including handling categorical variables and missing values.
- **Visualization:** Used various plots to visualize the relationships between features and the target variable.


## Results

The feature engineering and data preparation conducted in this project lay the groundwork for building effective predictive models. Future work can involve applying machine learning algorithms to the engineered features to predict flight prices with high accuracy.
